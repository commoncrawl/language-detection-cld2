This is a Java wrapper for the library CLD2 (https://code.google.com/p/cld2/)
using JNA.

Initially the classes CLDHints and Cld2Library were automatically generated
using jnaerator (https://code.google.com/p/jnaerator/). To use it we needed to
remove the include of <vector> as it crashed the app.

Then we executed the following command:
$ java -jar jnaerator-0.12-20140604.001151-54-shaded.jar -library Cld2 ~/language_detection/cld2/internal/generated_language.h ~/language_detection/cld2/public/encodings.h ~/language_detection/cld2/public/compact_lang_det.h -o . -v -noJar -noComp -runtime JNA -f -noComments

Then using:
$ nm libcld2_full.so
we got the mangled cpp names and replaced those in Cld2Library, this is because
of bug https://github.com/ochafik/nativelibs4java/issues/515.

We also removed lot of undesired content and made the class protected.
Note also, that we replaced the signature of ExtDetectLanguagesummary to use
arrays. We only keep one function, as the others can be easily implemented on
top of it.

We also extracted both Enumerations to their own classes.

In CLDHints, we replaced the pointers by strings and removed the references to
byreference and bypointer.

IMPORTANT: this bindings have only been tested for linux-x86-64, any other
OSes and flavors are not explicitly supported.
